Hi and welcome!

In order to create a custom deck of cards you need to follow few
rules.  First, the file should be saved in the root directory, or the
same folder that cards.txt is saved in.  Below is an example of how it
should look.  You need to type in order: Question,Answer,Category

Each should be separated by a comma , with no spaces between.  Be sure
not to use commas anywhere other than to separate Question,Answer,Category.
